# learningSpringFramework

This is a simple application that covers CRUD operations using spring mvc and hibernate.
As I learn more about spring I will increase the complexity of the application to include all aspect of the spring framework. 

My IDE of choice is SpringToolSuite4 since I'm using springboot I found this IDE to be quite useful. It is important to note that additional tools will be needed to configure SpringToolSuite4 namely Eclipse Web Developer Tools 3.21.

Configuration
-------------
Open SpringToolSuite4 go to Help -> Eclipse Marketplace and search and install Eclipse Web Developer Tools.

Install the latest version of Eclipse Web Developer Tools

My database of choice for this simple app is MySQL and the script files are included into the main directory namely studentMVC.

Run CreateUser.sql first then run StudentDatabase.sql

After the database connection is setup you can now run the application as a springboot application

Note the configuration for the database is located in studentMVC -> src/main/resources -> database.properties
